# Introduction

This folder contains the following data generators. The details have been listed under in the description below.

### Simplified Linear Model Data Generator
This is the code to collect trajectories using simplified linear model. The initial state is arbitrarily fixed each time. Different trajectories with variations are thus produced for the same board. These trajectories are then stored in a csv file.

### Unicycle Model Data Generator
This is the code to collect trajectories using unicycle model. The initial state is arbitrarily fixed each time. Different trajectories with variations are thus produced for the same board. These trajectories are then stored in a csv file.
